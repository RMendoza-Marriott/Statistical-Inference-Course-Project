Synopsis
The project consists of two parts:
1. Simulation Exercise to explore inference
2. Basic inferential analysis using the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package

Part 1: Simulation Exercise

The task is to investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution will be simulated in 
R with `rexp(n,lambda)` where `lambda is the rate parameter`. The mean of exponential distribution and the standard deviation are both `1/lambda` where `lambda = 0.2`, 
and distribution of averages of `40 exponentials` and will perform `1000 simulations`.
